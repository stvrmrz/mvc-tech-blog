## Roadmap

GIVEN a note-taking application
- [x] WHEN I open the Note Taker
      THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
- [x] WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
      THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
- [x] WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
      THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
- [x] WHEN I click on the Save button
      THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
- [x] WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
      THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
- [x] WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page
      THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears
